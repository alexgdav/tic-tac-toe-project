# Game Project Scope Study

## User Stories

As a mobile app user overall (and as a user who'd like to play both on mobile
and desktop) I'm frequently frustrated by how few modifications or mobile some
sites still have. I don't want to see small buttons too close to each other.
I don't want to see menus that can't be collapsed. I want each "screen" to give
me as much of one section as comfortably fits on it, and no more. I'd rather too
much whitespace than too little.

As a user, I would like to be able to see my history on an app or site. In
the tic tac toe project, that means signing in to not only play, but to see
a count of my past wins and losses, and the number of games I've played. If
adding multiplayer, it would be great to see how many solo games I've played,
and how many multiplayer.

It would be great to have a site that kept me logged in, so I don't have to log
in every time I want to play a game. Especially if I'm using the game on
multiple devices, having to log in on each device every single time I want to
play might get old quickly.

Though I would probably play an engaging enough game without flashy effects, I
would like this game to have some visual interest. Even a small effect, like a
line that connects a winning streak of Xs or Os, or a smiley or sad face with
the win/lose messages would enhance the gameplay experience.

I want to play again and again, but playing the same game without any change
might get boring. It would be great to have the game reward me for a winning
streak (without me looking up my stats). Some confetti and a simple message
coming up to say "you've won three in a row, keep it up" would make me want to
preserve that streak and see what I got for five, or ten.
